1. GetLatestVimScripts -- Getting Started	*getlatestvimscripts-start*

	The last step, that of renaming/moving the GetLatetsVimScripts.dist
	file, is for those who have just downloaded GetLatestVimScripts.tar.bz2
	for the first time.  The GetLatestVimScripts.dist file serves as an
	example and a template for your own personal list.  Feel free to remove
	all the scripts mentioned within it; the "important" part of it is the
	first two lines.

    Your computer needs to have wget for GetLatestVimScripts to do its work.

	1. Unix:
		cd $HOME/.vim
		bunzip2 GetLatestVimScripts.tar.bz2
		tar -oxvf GetLatestVimScripts.tar
		cd GetLatest
		mv GetLatestVimScripts.dist GetLatestVimScripts.dat
	
	2. Windows:
		cd
		cd vimfiles
		bunzip2 GetLatestVimScripts.tar.bz2
		tar -oxvf GetLatestVimScripts.tar
		cd GetLatest
		ren GetLatestVimScripts.dist GetLatestVimScripts.dat
	

==============================================================================
2. GetLatestVimScripts Usage				*getlatestvimscripts*	*glvs*

	While in vim, type

		:GetLatestVimScripts

	This command will examine .../GetLatest/GetLatestVimScripts.dat,
	pulling down the scripts listed therein if they're out of date.
	The GetLatestVimScripts.dat file will then be updated to reflect
	the downloading status.

	Scripts which have been downloaded will appear in the .../GetLatest
	subdirectory.

	GetLatestVimScripts will search along the runtimepath for the
	/GetLatest subdirectory.  The first such directory found will
	be the one used.


==============================================================================
3. GetLatestVimScripts Data File		*getlatestvimscripts-data* *glvs-data*

	The Data file has a header which should appear as:

		ScriptID SourceID Filename
		--------------------------

	Below that is a list of two columns of numbers and some text describing
	the associated script.

	The first number on each line is the script's ScriptID.  When you're about
	to use a web browser to look at scripts on http://vim.sf.net/, just before
	you click on the script's link, you'll see a line resembling

    	http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=40

    The "40" happens to be ScriptID that GetLatestVimScripts needs to download
	the associated page.

	Setting the SourceID to 1 insures that GetLatestVimScripts will download
	the associated script.  The SourceID is extracted by GetLatestVimScripts
	from the script's page on vim.sf.net; if its greater than the one stored
	in the GetLatestVimScripts.dat file, the script will be downloaded.


==============================================================================
4. GetLatestVimScripts Algorithm	*getlatestvimscripts-algorithm* *glvs-alg*

    The Vim sourceforge page dynamically creates a page keying off the
	so-called script-id.  Within the webpage of

    	http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=40

    is a line specifying the latest source-id (src_id).  The source identifier
	numbers are always increasing, hence if the src_id is greater than the one
	recorded for the script in GetLatestVimScripts then its time to download a
	newer copy of that script.

    GetLatestVimScripts will then download the script and update its internal
	database of script ids, source ids, and scriptnames.

5. GetLatestVimScripts History		*getlatestvimscripts-history* *glvs-hist*

	v10 Apr 19, 2004 : * moved history from script to doc
	                   * GetLatestVimScripts is now a plugin:
					     :GetLatestVimScripts command
						 (runtimepath)/GetLatest/GetLatestVimScripts.dat
	v9  Jan 23, 2004 : windows (win32/win16/win95) will use
	                   double quotes ("") whereas other systems will use
	                   single quotes ('') around the urls in calls via wget
	v8  Dec 01, 2003 : makes three tries at downloading
	v7  Sep 02, 2003 : added error messages if "Click on..." or "src_id="
	                   not found in downloaded webpage
	                   Uses t_ti, t_te, and rs to make progress visible
	v6  Aug 06, 2003 : final status messages now display summary of work
	                   ( "Downloaded someqty scripts" or
	                     "Everything was current")
	                   Now GetLatestVimScripts is careful about downloading
	                   GetLatestVimScripts.vim itself!
	                   (goes to <NEW_GetLatestVimScripts.vim>)
	v5  Aug 04, 2003 : missing an endif near bottom
	v4  Jun 17, 2003 : redraw! just before each "considering" message
	v3  May 27, 2003 : Protects downloaded files from errant shell
	                   expansions with single quotes: '...'
	v2  May 14, 2003 : extracts name of item to be obtained from the
	                   script file.  Uses it instead of comment field
	                   for output filename; comment is used in the
	                   "considering..." line and is now just a comment!
	                   * Fixed a bug: a string-of-numbers is not the
	                     same as a number, so I added zero to them
	                     and they became numbers.  Fixes comparison.
